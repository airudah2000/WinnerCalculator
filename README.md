[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/airudah2000/WinnerCalculator.svg?token=AxWK7JPPEewkrpghB9yM&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/airudah2000/WinnerCalculator)

Implementation for a popular online game.

The calculator finds the winning team(s) and winning player(s) from two files in the format like in:
1 WinnerCalculator/src/main/resources/scores.dat and
1 WinnerCalculator/src/main/resources/teams.dat

Two solutions implemented with Apache Spark. One with DataFrames and the other with a RDD
